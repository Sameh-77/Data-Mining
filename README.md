# Data-Mining-Assignment1
Understanding Data and Preprocessing


In this assignment, I had a dataset about covid-19. The data is collected in US and have more than 10,000
participants data. I had to do 3 tasks in the assignment as follows: 

1. Charactarise Data
2. Charactarise Attributes
3. Preprossing

# Data-Mining-Assignment2 
Data Classification 

In this assignment, I had a dataset about lung cancer. This assignment is to use a classification method that uses the attributes/features given in
this dataset to identify the lung cancer possibility (either yes or no). So it's a binary classificaition. Firstly, the data is cleaned and preprocessed, then,
it has been divided to training and testig, then the model is build. 10-fold cross validation is used to evaluate the model.
