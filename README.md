# Data-Mining-Assignment1
Understanding Data and Preprocessing


In this assignment, I had a dataset about covid-19. The data is collected in US and have more than 10,000
participants data. I had to do 3 tasks in the assignment as follows: 

1. Charactarise Data
2. Charactarise Attributes
3. Preprossing

# Data-Mining-Assignment2 
Data Classification 

In this assignment, I had a dataset about lung cancer. This assignment is to use a classification method that uses the attributes/features given in
this dataset to identify the lung cancer possibility (either yes or no). So it's a binary classificaition. Firstly, the data is cleaned and preprocessed, then,
it has been divided to training and testig, then the model is build. 10-fold cross validation is used to evaluate the model.

# Data-Mining-Assignment3
Association Mining and Clustering

In this assignment, I was given the data of 38 people from an eye-tracking experiment with the same web page, and I had to apply some Apriori and DBSCAN expiremnts.

#Project
Fake News Detection 
It's a group project, where we had two datasets and we applied some data preprocessing and cleaning, then we build some models using 4 different algorithms, which are
Logistic Regression, Naive-Bayes, Decision Trees, and Passive-Aggressive Classifies. 

Below is the abstract of the project: 

Fake news has recently become a real problem, with the
internet making it easy to spread and be consumed by general
public. It is such a problem that it has garnered mass interest
in research to accurately detect it on online platforms. To this
end, many solutions have been provided. In this paper we seek
to compare 4 of these algorithms to see which will yield the
highest accuracy. We ran our tests on 2 datasets and the results
were a little polarizing, with one dataset having its highest
accuracy to be 64% and the other being 93%.
